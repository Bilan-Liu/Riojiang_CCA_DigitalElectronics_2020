## --------ultrasonic sensor

This week, i tried to figure out the part of the ultrasonic sensor with a speaker that can make the sounds by distance.  So I used two ultrasonic sensors to detect two kinds of distance, which can trigger two sounds.  


### I found the problem:

1.
I refer to the online tutorials for programming
https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/javier-munoz-saez/arduino-mp3-player-distance-sensor-fun-6b1bce
But for the MP3 module, I chose Adafruit Audio FX sound board. This is not the same as the tutorial. So I'm trying to change the code.

2. 
How to add MP3 files to Arduino
