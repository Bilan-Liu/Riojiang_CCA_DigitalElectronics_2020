# Week3-The most vulnerable shield 

When we think of shields we think of strong armies, strong men. Whenever war begins, shields help people resist attacks. But must the shield be strong inside?
So I wanted to show a shield of character, who was shy, scared, even lonely. Because no one understands the heart of a shield.

## Week 2
   
 What I interest project:   
   
   This project is about how to make a time machine! This DIY time control machine looks like a glove, and can "stop" any moving subject. First part of this video is about some demonstration and experiments, and second - about how to make this time machine, using Arduino, high-power LED and some tricky magic with soldering iron. You can use this for pranks and demonstration of stroboscopic effect.
